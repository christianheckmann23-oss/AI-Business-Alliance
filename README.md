## Fraternity ERP Module
This site now includes a **Fraternity ERP** workflow for cabinet and executive members:
- Shared-password login (no individual accounts required).
- Structured form submission for operations records.
- Automatic conversion of submissions into downloadable document files.
- Local archive grouped by folder/department so current and future members can reference past resources.

### Shared password configuration
The default shared password is configured in `index.html` as `ERP_SHARED_PASSWORD`.
Update this value before production deployment.
